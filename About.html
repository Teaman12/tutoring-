            We take education and make it as practical as possible. We believe this is the first step in 
        understanding the importance of why you are doing what you are doing and where it 
               will take you. This addresses careers and real life applications. 
    





        Our mission: Things are changing, see you soon in the metaverse and
                               looking forward to seeing you, your avatar.
