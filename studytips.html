<h3>When you are about to study</h3>
<li>Your mind is shifting, it is leaving everything that it percieve as fun and into<br>
     what it percieve as hard </li><br>

    Give yourself time to adjust.</li> <br>

<li>The second 30 minute, creates a shift(focus on work, ask yourself questions on the subject) your mind has adjusted to the study environment.</li><br>
