The first 30 minutes of studying is the hardest, Why? The goal is to survive the first hour. How?</p><br>
<h3>When you are about to study</h3>
<li>Your mind is shifting, it is leaving everything that it percieve as fun and into<br>
     what it percieve as hard </li><br>
<li>Between leaving good conversations, social media, television or the feeling to go and sleep.<br>
    Give yourself time to adjust.</li> <br>   
<li>Studying is like exercising, the first 30 minutes should be taken as jogging.</li><br>
<li>The second 30 minute, creates a shift(focus on work, ask yourself questions on the subject) your mind has adjusted to the study environment.</li><br>
